OpenGR
======

OpenGR is a set C++ libraries for 3D Global Registration.
It is a fork of the [Super4PCS library](https://github.com/nmellado/Super4PCS), and aims at providing several state of the art global registration algorithms for 3d data.
This fork is maintened by the same authors as the Super4PCS library.

Documentation: [https://storm-irit.github.io/OpenGR/](https://storm-irit.github.io/OpenGR/)

The library is currently under refactoring in order to:
 - add mechanisms to switch between different registration algorithms
 - factorize piece of codes shared by multiple algorithms
 - update the code with the new library name
 - remove some dependencies
 - update the documentation
